# my-react-project

I've created a Chelsea Fan Club blog which is a single page web application using React, Sass, Gulp & Node.js. The application loads as a single HTML file. Main benefit of using react is that it only update particular areas of the webpage & won't reload the dom. The header of the webpage contains the Chelsea logo and heading. The body comprises of three blogs(pages) about the history, stadium and introduction about Chelsea. I'm a very big David Luiz fan so I've dedicated the footer to him. The page also has a Chelsea favicon & title.

Before running the app make sure npm, node & react dependencies are installed. Then go to the root directory in command prompt and run "npm start" to launch the server(localhost).
